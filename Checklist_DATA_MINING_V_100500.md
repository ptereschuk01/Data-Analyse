Additionally: identification of anomalies, outliers, logical integrity  

🔹 Recommendation: Document all checks in a table or a Data Quality Report to present them to stakeholders.  

3. Data Preparation  

3.1 Data Loading and Initial Review  

3.1.0 Environment Setup  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and other libraries.  
Connection to storage locations: Google Drive, local files, databases.  

3.1.1 Importing Libraries and Loading Data  
pd.read_csv, pd.read_excel, SQL queries or API.  
Verification of successful import, number of rows/columns.  

3.1.2 Initial Data Overview (Exploratory Check)  
Table dimensions, data types, sample records.  
Basic statistics: mean, median, std, min/max, quantiles.  
Immediately visible issues: missing values, duplicates, outliers.  

3.2 Data Cleaning / Preprocessing  

3.2.1 Handling Missing Values  
Removal of rows or columns with critical missing values.  
Imputation: mean, median, mode, “Unknown”, 0, etc.  
Documentation of the chosen strategy.  

3.2.2 Removal of Duplicates and Non-Informative Features  

3.2.2.1 Technical Identifiers  
ID, UUID, ticket numbers, indices  

3.2.2.2 Features with Zero or Near-Zero Variance  
Identical values in all rows  

3.2.2.3 Redundant Features  
Derived from each other (e.g., date and year)  

3.2.2.4 Columns with Identical Values  
E.g., column “Gender” if all entries are “Male”  

3.2.3 Treatment of Outliers  
Cause analysis: error, rare case, real extreme value  
Removal or transformation (logarithm, winsorization)  

3.2.4 Exclusion of Clearly Non-Informative Data  
Features without influence on the target variable: random codes, indices, technical fields  

3.3 Data Transformation (Feature Engineering / Transformation)  

3.3.0 Definition of the Target Variable  
What is predicted and at what point in time.  

3.3.1 Conversion of Data Types  
Dates → datetime  
Categories → category  
Numeric → float/int if necessary  

3.3.2 Separation of Features by Type  
Quantitative: age, price, income, number of purchases  
Qualitative: color, gender, city, car brand, payment method  
Binary: 1/0, Yes/No  

3.3.3 Quantitative Features  
Keep as is or standardize (StandardScaler) / normalize (MinMaxScaler)  

3.3.4 Encoding of Categorical Features  
Ordinal Encoding: if there is a natural order (“bad”, “average”, “good”)  
One-Hot Encoding: if order is not relevant  
Label Encoding: if there are few categories and numerical interpretation is acceptable  

3.3.5 Creation of New Features (Feature Engineering)  
Aggregations (mean, sum, max/min)  
Ratios  
Time features (year, month, day of week, season)  
Domain-specific features (e.g., “number of purchases in the last 30 days”)  

3.3.6 Data Leakage Check  
Exclusion of features containing future information or directly dependent on the target variable  

🔹 Additional Recommendations:  
1. Document all steps — especially for missing values, duplicates, and encoding.  
2. Visual data control — hist, boxplot, value_counts for categories.  
3. Logical plausibility check — e.g., age > 0, purchase date ≤ today.  
4. Save intermediate versions after each preprocessing step.  

8. Exploratory Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis, EDA)  

4.1 Descriptive Statistics  
Calculation of key metrics for all quantitative features:  
Mean (mean)  
Median (median)  
Standard deviation (std)  
Minimum/maximum (min/max)  
Quartiles/percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%)  

4.2 Distribution Analysis  
Checking normality and feature distributions  
Determination of skewness and kurtosis  
Identification of anomalies and outliers  

4.3 Data Visualization  
Histograms – for distributions of quantitative features  
Boxplot – for identification of outliers  
Scatter plots – for analyzing the relationship between two quantitative features  
Heatmap – for visualization of correlations  
Bar chart – for categorical features  

4.4 Correlation Analysis  
Checking linear relationships between quantitative features  
For categorical features – chi2 or Cramér's V  
Identification of multicollinearity for modeling   

4.5 Segmentation and Hypothesis Testing  
Dividing the data into groups by key features (e.g., Pclass, gender, age groups)  
Hypothesis testing using statistical methods:  
t-test, ANOVA – for quantitative features  
chi2 – for categorical features  

🔹 Additionally:  
1. Document all charts and statistical results in the report/notebook  
2. Record conclusions in Markdown: which features are important, which outliers should be removed, which hypotheses are confirmed  
3. EDA forms the basis for feature engineering and model selection
